# ClickerGame 

The clicker game is a light, interactive Unity project where players repeatedly click a button to increase their score. It includes a humorous background for visual appeal and features buttons to save and load the score using Unityâ€™s PlayerPrefs, ensuring progress can be retained between sessions. Another button allows the score to be decreased, adding a small twist to the otherwise straightforward clicking mechanic. It serves as a great foundation for learning UI interaction, basic game logic, and data persistence in Unity.
